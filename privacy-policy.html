      faces in photos and camera experiences. We may detect and use facial marks to

      Services may utilize calculation results of certain AR technologies in

      effect and perform&nbsp;feature analysis using the algorithm.&nbsp;The

      recommendation is finished&nbsp;or upon the closing of the application  or  website, the
      facial mapping&nbsp;information is discarded. This&nbsp;information is not
      shared with any third parties.&nbsp;

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      We will only collect and process personal information where we have lawful
      bases and we typically rely on one of the following four legal bases: -
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>consent(where you have given consent);</li>
      <li>
        contract (where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract
        with you, for example, to operate the site or deliver any services you have
        requested);
      </li>
      <li>
        legitimate interests (for example we need to use your information to provide
        and improve our Services, including protecting your account, providing
        customer support). We rely on our legitimate interests as our lawful basis
        only where those interests are not overridden by the impact on you (unless
        we have your consent or our processing is otherwise required or permitted by
        law); and
      </li>
      <li>
        legal obligations (to comply with the laws, rules and regulations or
        requests by government departments, judicial authorities or law
        enforcement).
      </li>
    </ul>

              This means that you have the right to obtain from us the erasure of your
              personal data and we are obliged to erase your personal data without undue
              delay when one of the reasons listed in Art.&nbsp;17&nbsp;(1) GDPR applies.
              This can be the case, for example, if personal data are no longer necessary in
              relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed
              (Art.&nbsp;17&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;(a) GDPR).

              (Art.&nbsp;17&nbsp;(3)&nbsp;(b) and (e) GDPR).

              processing if one of the conditions provided in Art.&nbsp;18&nbsp;(1) GDPR
              applies. This can be the case, for example, if you contest the accuracy of the
              personal data. In such a case, the restriction of processing lasts for a
              period that enables us to verify the accuracy of the personal data
