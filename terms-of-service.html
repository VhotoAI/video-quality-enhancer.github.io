    </p>
    <p>
      (i) In addition to the choice of law made in Section 17, the following
      shall apply: The statutory provisions limiting the choice of law remain
      unaffected. In particular, within the territorial scope of Article 6(2) of
      European Union Regulation (EC) No. 593/2008 (so-called &ldquo;Rome I
      Regulation&rdquo;) the following applies: If the law of the country where
      you, as a consumer, at the time of conclusion of the contract have your
      habitual residence (hereinafter &ldquo;right of residence&rdquo;) contains
      provisions for your protection which may not be deviated from by agreement
      under the right of residence, the (more favorable) provisions of the right
      of residence apply to you. Therefore, you enjoy the protection of the
      mandatory provisions of the right of residence despite the choice of law
      pursuant to Section 18.

      (ii) With regard to the Virtual Goods and Subscription Service, the

      and Regulations (as applicable), generally have a statutory right of
      withdrawal/cancel when concluding a distance selling contract, about which
      we will inform you below in accordance with the statutory model
